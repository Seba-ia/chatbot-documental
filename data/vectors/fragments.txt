---
AI chatbots shook the world not long ago with their potential to revolutionize edu-
---
cation systems in a myriad of ways. AI chatbots can provide immediate support
---
by answering questions, offering explanations, and providing additional resources.
---
Chatbots can also act as virtual teaching assistants, supporting educators through vari-
---
ous means. In this paper, we try to understand the full benefits of AI chatbots in edu-
---
cation, their opportunities, challenges, potential limitations, concerns, and prospects
---
of using AI chatbots in educational settings. We conducted an extensive search
---
across various academic databases, and after applying specific predefined criteria, we
---
selected a final set of 67 relevant studies for review. The research findings emphasize
---
the numerous benefits of integrating AI chatbots in education, as seen from both stu-
---
dents’ and educators’ perspectives. We found that students primarily gain from AI-
---
powered chatbots in three key areas: homework and study assistance, a personalized
---
learning experience, and the development of various skills. For educators, the main
---
advantages are the time-saving assistance and improved pedagogy. However, our
---
research also emphasizes significant challenges and critical factors that educators need
---
to handle diligently. These include concerns related to AI applications such as reliability,

The traditional education system faces several issues, including overcrowded classrooms,
---
a lack of personalized attention for students, varying learning paces and styles, and the
---
struggle to keep up with the fast-paced evolution of technology and information. As the
---
educational landscape continues to evolve, the rise of AI-powered chatbots emerges as a
---
promising solution to effectively address some of these issues. Some educational institu-
---
tions are increasingly turning to AI-powered chatbots, recognizing their relevance, while
---
others are more cautious and do not rush to adopt them in modern educational settings.
---
Consequently, a substantial body of academic literature is dedicated to investigating the
---
role of AI chatbots in education, their potential benefits, and threats.
---
AI-powered chatbots are designed to mimic human conversation using text or voice
---
interaction, providing information in a conversational manner. Chatbots’ history dates
---
Labadze et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ  (2023) 20:56
---
back to the 1960s and over the decades chatbots have evolved significantly, driven by
---
advancements in technology and the growing demand for automated communication
---
systems. Created by Joseph Weizenbaum at MIT in 1966, ELIZA was one of the earli-
---
est chatbot programs (Weizenbaum, 1966). ELIZA could mimic human-like responses
---
by reflecting user inputs as questions. Another early example of a chatbot was PARRY,
---
implemented in 1972 by psychiatrist Kenneth Colby at Stanford University (Colby,
---
1981). PARRY was a chatbot designed to simulate a paranoid patient with schizophre-
---
nia. It engaged in text-based conversations and demonstrated the ability to exhibit delu-
---
sional behavior, offering insights into natural language processing and AI. Developed by
---
Richard Wallace in 1995, ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity) was an
---
early example of a chatbot using natural language processing techniques that won the
---
Loebner Prize Turing Test in 2000–2001 (Wallace, 1995), which challenged chatbots to
---
convincingly simulate human-like conversation. Later in 2001 ActiveBuddy, Inc. devel-
---
oped the chatbot SmarterChild that operated on instant messaging platforms such as
---
AOL Instant Messenger and MSN Messenger (Hoffer et al., 2001). SmarterChild was a
---
chatbot that could carry on conversations with users about a variety of topics. It was
---
also able to learn from its interactions with users, which made it more and more sophis-
---
ticated over time. In 2011 Apple introduced Siri as a voice-activated personal assistant
---
for its iPhone (Aron, 2011). Although not strictly a chatbot, Siri showcased the potential
---
of conversational AI by understanding and responding to voice commands, performing
---
tasks, and providing information. In the same year, IBM’s Watson gained fame by defeat-
---
ing human champions in the quiz show Jeopardy (Lally & Fodor, 2011). It demonstrated
---
the power of natural language processing and machine learning algorithms in under-
---
standing complex questions and providing accurate answers. More recently, in 2016,
---
Facebook opened its Messenger platform for chatbot development, allowing businesses
---
to create AI-powered conversational agents to interact with users. This led to an explo-
---
sion of chatbots on the platform, enabling tasks like customer support, news delivery,
---
and e-commerce (Holotescu, 2016). Google Duplex, introduced in May 2018, was able
---
to make phone calls and carry out conversations on behalf of users. It showcased the
---
potential of chatbots to handle complex, real-time interactions in a human-like manner
---
(Dinh & Thai, 2018; Kietzmann et al., 2018).
---
More recently, more sophisticated and capable chatbots amazed the world with their
---
abilities. Among them, ChatGPT and Google Bard are among the most profound AI-
---
powered chatbots. ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI.
---
It was first announced in November 2022 and is available to the general public. Chat-
---
GPT’s rival Google Bard chatbot, developed by Google AI, was first announced in May
---
2023. Both Google Bard and ChatGPT are sizable language model chatbots that undergo
---
training on extensive datasets of text and code. They possess the ability to generate text,
---
create diverse creative content, and provide informative answers to questions, although
---
their accuracy may not always be perfect. The key difference is that Google Bard is
---
trained on a dataset that includes text from the internet, while ChatGPT is trained on a
---
dataset that includes text from books and articles. This means that Google Bard is more
---
likely to be up-to-date on current events, while ChatGPT is more likely to be accurate
---
in its responses to factual questions (AlZubi et al., 2022; Rahaman et al., 2023; Rudolph
---
Labadze et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ  (2023) 20:56
---
Chatbots are now used across various sectors, including education. Most of the
---
latest intelligent AI chatbots are web-based platforms that adapt to the behaviors
---
of both instructors and learners, enhancing the educational experience (Chassignol
---
et al., 2018; Devedzic, 2004; Kahraman et al., 2010; Peredo et al., 2011). AI chatbots
---
have been applied in both instruction and learning within the education sector. Chat-
---
bots specialize in personalized tutoring, homework help, concept learning, standard-
---
ized test preparation, discussion and collaboration, and mental health support. Some
---
of the most popular AI-based tools /chatbots used in education are:
---
•	 Bard, introduced in 2022, is a large language model chatbot created by Google
---
AI. Its capabilities include generating text, language translation, producing vari-
---
ous types of creative content, and providing informative responses to questions.
---
(Rudolph et al., 2023). Bard is still under development, but it has the potential to
---
•	 ChatGPT, launched in 2022 by OpenAI, is a large language model chatbot that can
---
generate text, produce diverse creative content, and deliver informative answers to
---
questions (Dergaa et al., 2023; Khademi, 2023; Rudolph et al., 2023). However, as
---
discussed in the results section of this paper, there are numerous concerns related
---
to the use of ChatGPT in education, such as accuracy, reliability, ethical issues,
---
•	 Ada, launched in 2017, is a chatbot that is used to provide personalized tutoring to
---
students. It can answer questions, provide feedback, and facilitate individualized
---
learning for students (Kabiljo et al., 2020; Konecki et al., 2023). However, the Ada
---
chatbot has limitations in understanding complex queries. It could misinterpret
---
•	 Replika, launched in 2017, is an AI chatbot platform that is designed to be a friend
---
and companion for students. It can listen to students’ problems, offer advice, and
---
help them feel less alone (Pentina et  al., 2023; Xie & Pentina, 2022). However,
---
given the personal nature of conversations with Replika, there are valid concerns
---
•	 Socratic, launched in 2013, had the goal of creating a community that made learn-
---
ing accessible to all students. Currently, Socratic is an AI-powered educational
---
platform that was acquired by Google in 2018. While not a chatbot per se, it has a
---
chatbot-like interface and functionality designed to assist students in learning new
---
concepts (Alsanousi et al., 2023; Moppel, 2018; St-Hilaire et al., 2022). Like with
---
other chatbots, a concern arises where students might excessively rely on Socratic
---
for learning. This could lead to a diminished emphasis on critical thinking, as stu-
---
dents may opt to use the platform to obtain answers without gaining a genuine
---
understanding of the underlying concepts.
---
•	 Habitica, launched in 2013, is used to help students develop good study habits.
---
It gamifies the learning process, making it more fun and engaging for students.
---
Students can use Habitica to manage their academic tasks, assignments, and study
---
schedules. By turning their to-do list into a game-like experience, students are
---
motivated to complete their tasks and build productive habits (Sales & Antunes,
---
2021; Zhang, 2023). However, the gamified nature of Habitica could inadvertently
---
Labadze et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ  (2023) 20:56
---
introduce distractions, especially for students who are easily drawn into the gam-
---
ing aspect rather than focusing on their actual academic responsibilities.
---
•	 Piazza launched in 2009, is used to facilitate discussion and collaboration in educa-
---
tional settings, particularly in classrooms and academic institutions. It provides a
---
space for students and instructors to engage in discussions, ask questions, and share
---
information related to course content and assignments (Ruthotto et al., 2020; Wang
---
et al., 2020). Because discussions on Piazza are user-generated, the quality and accu-
---
racy of responses can vary. This variability may result in situations where students do
---
not receive accurate and helpful information.
---
We will likely see even more widespread adoption of chatbots in education in the years
---
to come as technology advances further. Chatbots have enormous potential to improve
---
teaching and learning. A large body of literature is devoted to exploring the role, chal-
---
lenges, and opportunities of chatbots in education. This paper gathers and synthesizes
---
this vast amount of literature, providing a comprehensive understanding of the current
---
research status concerning the influence of chatbots in education. By conducting a sys-
---
tematic review, we seek to identify common themes, trends, and patterns in the impact
---
of chatbots on education and provide a holistic view of the research, enabling research-
---
ers, policymakers, and educators to make evidence-based decisions. One of the main
---
objectives of this paper is to identify existing research gaps in the literature to pinpoint
---
areas where further investigation is needed, enabling researchers to contribute to the
---
knowledge base and guide future research efforts. Firstly, we aim to understand the pri-
---
mary advantages of incorporating AI chatbots in education, focusing on the perspectives
---
of students. Secondly, we seek to explore the key advantages of integrating AI chatbots
---
from the standpoint of educators. Lastly, we endeavor to comprehensively analyze the
---
major concerns expressed by scholars regarding the integration of AI chatbots in educa-
---
tional settings. Corresponding research questions are formulated in the section below.
---
Addressing these research questions, we aim to contribute valuable insights that shed

It is evident that chatbot technology has a significant impact on overall learning out-
---
comes. Specifically, chatbots have demonstrated significant enhancements in learning
---
achievement, explicit reasoning, and knowledge retention. The integration of chatbots
---
in education offers benefits such as immediate assistance, quick access to information,
---
enhanced learning outcomes, and improved educational experiences. However, there
---
have been contradictory findings related to critical thinking, learning engagement,
---
and motivation. Deng and Yu (2023) found that chatbots had a significant and positive
---
influence on numerous learning-related aspects but they do not significantly improve
---
motivation among students. Contrary, Okonkwo and Ade-Ibijola (Okonkwo & Ade-Ibi-
---
jola, 2021), as well as (Wollny et al., 2021) find that using chatbots increases students’

In terms of application, chatbots are primarily used in education to teach various sub-
---
jects, including but not limited to mathematics, computer science, foreign languages,
---
and engineering. While many chatbots follow predetermined conversational paths,
---
some employ personalized learning approaches tailored to individual student needs,
---
incorporating experiential and collaborative learning principles. Challenges in chatbot
---
development include insufficient training datasets, a lack of emphasis on usability heu-
---
ristics, ethical concerns, evaluation methods, user attitudes, programming complexities,
---
Although existing systematic reviews have provided valuable insights into the impact
---
of chatbot technology in education, it’s essential to acknowledge that the field of chatbot

remarkable capabilities in natural language processing and generation. Additional
---
research is required to investigate the role and potential of these newer chatbots in the
---
field of education. Therefore, our paper focuses on reviewing and discussing the findings
---
of these new-generation chatbots’ use in education, including their benefits and chal-
---
lenges from the perspectives of both educators and students.
---
There are a few aspects that appear to be missing from the existing literature reviews:
---
(a) The existing findings focus on the immediate impact of chatbot usage on learning
---
outcomes. Further research may delve into the enduring impacts of integrating chatbots
---
in education, aiming to assess their sustainability and the persistence of the observed
---
advantages over the long term. (b) The studies primarily discuss the impact of chatbots
---
on learning outcomes as a whole, without delving into the potential variations based on
---
student characteristics. Investigating how different student groups, such as age, prior
---
knowledge, and learning styles, interact with chatbot technology could provide valuable
---
insights. (c) Although the studies highlight the enhancements in certain learning compo-
---
nents, further investigation could explore the specific pedagogical strategies employed
---
by chatbots to achieve these outcomes. Understanding the underlying mechanisms and
---
instructional approaches utilized by chatbots can guide the development of more effec-
---
tive and targeted educational interventions. (d) While some studies touch upon user
---
attitudes and acceptance, further research can delve deeper into the user experience of
---
interacting with chatbots in educational settings. This includes exploring factors such
---
as usability, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and preferences of students and teachers
---
Addressing these gaps in the existing literature would significantly benefit the field
---
of education. Firstly, further research on the impacts of integrating chatbots can shed
---
light on their long-term sustainability and how their advantages persist over time. This
---
knowledge is crucial for educators and policymakers to make informed decisions about
---
the continued integration of chatbots into educational systems. Secondly, understand-
---
ing how different student characteristics interact with chatbot technology can help tai-
---
lor educational interventions to individual needs, potentially optimizing the learning
---
experience. Thirdly, exploring the specific pedagogical strategies employed by chatbots
---
to enhance learning components can inform the development of more effective educa-
---
tional tools and methods. Lastly, a deeper exploration of the user experience with chat-
---
bots, encompassing usability, satisfaction, and preferences, can provide valuable insights
---
into enhancing user engagement and overall satisfaction, thus guiding the future design
---
and implementation of chatbot technology in education.
---
A systematic review follows a rigorous methodology, including predefined search cri-
---
teria and systematic screening processes, to ensure the inclusion of relevant studies.
---
This comprehensive approach ensures that a wide range of research is considered, mini-
---
mizing the risk of bias and providing a comprehensive overview of the impact of AI in
---
education. Firstly, we define the research questions and corresponding search strategies
---
and then we filter the search results based on predefined inclusion and exclusion crite-
---
ria. Secondly, we study selected articles and synthesize results and lastly, we report and
---
Labadze et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ  (2023) 20:56
---
discuss the findings. To improve the clarity of the discussion section, we employed Large
---
Language Model (LLM) for stylistic suggestions.
---
Considering the limitations observed in previous literature reviews, we have devel-
---
oped three research questions for further investigation:
---
1.	 What are the key advantages of incorporating AI chatbots in education from the
---
2.	 What are the key advantages of integrating AI chatbots in education from the view-
---
3.	 What are the main concerns raised by scholars regarding the integration of AI chat-
---
Exploring the literature that focuses on these research questions, with specific
---
attention to contemporary AI-powered chatbots, can provide a deeper understanding
---
of the impact, effectiveness, and potential limitations of chatbot technology in educa-
---
tion while guiding its future development and implementation. This paper will help
---
to better understand how educational chatbots can be effectively utilized to enhance
---
education and address the specific needs and challenges of students and educators.
---
The search for the relevant literature was conducted in the following databases:
---
ACM Digital Library, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar. The search string
---
was created using Boolean operators, and it was structured as follows: (“Education”
---
or “Learning” or “Teaching”) and (“Chatbot” or “Artificial intelligence” or “AI” or
---
“ChatGPT”). Initially, the search yielded a total of 563 papers from all four databases.
---
Search filters were applied based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, fol-
---
lowed by a rigorous data extraction strategy as explained below.
---
In our review process, we carefully adhered to the inclusion and exclusion crite-
---
ria specified in Table 2. Criteria were determined to ensure the studies chosen are

relevant to the research question (content, timeline) and maintain a certain level of
---
quality (literature type) and consistency (language, subject area).
---
All three authors collaborated to select the articles, ensuring consistency and reliabil-
---
ity. Each article was reviewed by at least two co-authors. The article selection process
---
involved the following stages: Initially, the authors reviewed the studies’ metadata, titles,
---
abstracts, keywords and eliminated articles that were not relevant to research questions.
---
This reduced the number of studies to 139. Next, the authors evaluated the quality of the
---
studies by assessing research methodology, sample size, research design, and clarity of
---
objectives, further refining the selection to 85 articles. Finally, the authors thoroughly
---
read the entire content of the articles. Studies offering limited empirical evidence related
---
to our research questions were excluded. This final step reduced the number of papers to
---
67. Figure 1 presents the article selection process.
---
In this section, we present the results of the reviewed articles, focusing on our research
---
questions, particularly with regard to ChatGPT. ChatGPT, as one of the latest AI-pow-
---
ered chatbots, has gained significant attention for its potential applications in education.
---
Within just eight months of its launch in 2022, it has already amassed over 100 million
---
users, setting new records for user and traffic growth. ChatGPT stands out among AI-
---
powered chatbots used in education due to its advanced natural language processing
---
capabilities and sophisticated language generation, enabling more natural and human-
---
like conversations. It excels at capturing and retaining contextual information through-
---
out interactions, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant conversations.
---
Unlike some educational chatbots that follow predetermined paths or rely on predefined
---
scripts, ChatGPT is capable of engaging in open-ended dialogue and adapting to various
---
user inputs. Its adaptability allows it to write articles, stories, and poems, provide sum-
---
maries, accommodate different perspectives, and even write and debug computer code,
---
making it a valuable tool in educational settings (Baidoo-Anu & Owusu Ansah, 2023;
---
Research question 1. What are the key advantages of incorporating AI chatbots in education
---
The integration of chatbots and virtual assistants into educational settings has the poten-
---
tial to transform support services, improve accessibility, and contribute to more efficient
---
and effective learning environments (Chen et al., 2023; Essel et al., 2022). AI tools have the
---

---
Labadze et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ  (2023) 20:56
---
potential to improve student success and engagement, particularly among those from dis-
---
advantaged backgrounds (Sullivan et al., 2023). However, the existing literature highlights
---
an important gap in the discussion from a student’s standpoint. A few existing research
---
studies addressing the student’s perspective of using ChatGPT in the learning process indi-
---
cate that students have a positive view of ChatGPT, appreciate its capabilities, and find it
---
helpful for their studies and work (Kasneci et al., 2023; Shoufan, 2023). Students acknowl-
---
edge that ChatGPT’s answers are not always accurate and emphasize the need for solid
---
background knowledge to utilize it effectively, recognizing that it cannot replace human
---
intelligence (Shoufan, 2023). Common most important benefits identified by scholars are:
---
•	 Homework and Study Assistance. AI-powered chatbots can provide detailed feedback
---
on student assignments, highlighting areas of improvement and offering suggestions for
---
further learning (Celik et al., 2022). For example, ChatGPT can act as a helpful study
---
companion, providing explanations and clarifications on various subjects. It can assist
---
with homework questions, offering step-by-step solutions and guiding students through
---
complex problems (Crawford et  al., 2023; Fauzi et  al., 2023; Lo, 2023; Qadir, 2023;
---
Shidiq, 2023). According to Sedaghat (2023) experiment, ChatGPT performed simi-
---
larly to third-year medical students on medical exams, and could write quite impressive
---
essays. Students can also use ChatGPT to quiz themselves on various subjects, reinforc-
---

•	 Flexible personalized learning. AI-powered chatbots in general are now able to pro-
---
vide individualized guidance and feedback to students, helping them navigate through
---
challenging concepts and improve their understanding. These systems can adapt their
---
teaching strategies to suit each student’s unique needs (Fariani et al., 2023; Kikalish-
---
vili, 2023; Schiff, 2021). Students can access ChatGPT anytime, making it convenient.
---
According to Kasneci et al. (2023), ChatGPT’s interactive and conversational nature can
---
enhance students’ engagement and motivation, making learning more enjoyable and
---
personalized. (Khan et al., 2023) examine the impact of ChatGPT on medical educa-
---
tion and clinical management, highlighting its ability to offer students tailored learning
---
•	 Skills development. It can aid in the enhancement of writing skills (by offering sugges-
---
tions for syntactic and grammatical corrections) (Kaharuddin, 2021), foster problem-
---
solving abilities (by providing step-by-step solutions) (Benvenuti et al., 2023), and facili-
---
tate group discussions and debates (by furnishing discussion structures and providing
---
real-time feedback) (Ruthotto et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020).

Research question 2. What are the key advantages of integrating AI chatbots in education
---
With the current capabilities of AI and its future potential, AI-powered chatbots, like
---
ChatGPT, can have a significant impact on existing instructional practices. Major
---
benefits from educators’ viewpoint identified in the literature are:
---
•	 Time-Saving Assistance. AI chatbot administrative support capabilities can help
---
educators save time on routine tasks, including scheduling, grading, and provid-
---
ing information to students, allowing them to allocate more time for instructional
---
planning and student engagement. For example, ChatGPT can successfully gen-
---
erate various types of questions and answer keys in different disciplines. How-
---
ever, educators should exercise critical evaluation and customization to suit their
---
unique teaching contexts. The expertise, experience, and comprehension of the
---
teacher are essential in making informed pedagogical choices, as AI is not yet
---
capable of replacing the role of a science teacher (Cooper, 2023).
---
•	 Improved pedagogy. Educators can leverage AI chatbots to augment their instruc-
---
tion and provide personalized support. According to Herft (2023), there are vari-
---
ous ways in which teachers can utilize ChatGPT to enhance their pedagogical
---
approaches and assessment methods. For instance, Educators can leverage the
---
capabilities of ChatGPT to generate open-ended question prompts that align pre-
---
cisely with the targeted learning objectives and success criteria of the instructional
---
unit. By doing so, teachers can tailor educational content to cater to the distinct
---
needs, interests, and learning preferences of each student, offering personalized
---
learning materials and activities (Al Ka’bi, 2023; Fariani et al., 2023).
---
Research question 3. What are the main concerns raised by scholars regarding the integration
---
Scholars’ opinions on using AI in this regard are varied and diverse. Some see AI chat-
---
bots as the future of teaching and learning, while others perceive them as a potential
---
threat. The main arguments of skeptical scholars are threefold:
---
•	 Reliability and Accuracy. AI chatbots may provide biased responses or non-accu-
---
rate information (Kasneci et al., 2023; Sedaghat, 2023). If the chatbot provides
---
incorrect information or guidance, it could mislead students and hinder their
---
learning progress. According to Sevgi et al. (2023), although ChatGPT exhibited
---
captivating and thought-provoking answers, it should not be regarded as a relia-
---
ble information source. This point is especially important for medical education.
---
Within the field of medical education, it is crucial to guarantee the reliability and
---
accuracy of the information chatbots provide (Khan et  al., 2023). If the train-
---
ing data used to develop an AI chatbot contains biases, the chatbot may inad-
---
vertently reproduce those biases in its responses, potentially including skewed
---
Labadze et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ  (2023) 20:56
---
perspectives, stereotypes, discriminatory language, or biased recommendations.
---
This is of particular concern in an educational context.
---
•	 Fair assessments. One of the challenges that educators face with the integration
---
of Chatbots in education is the difficulty in assessing students’ work, particularly
---
when it comes to written assignments or responses. AI-generated text detection,
---
while continually improving, is not yet foolproof and can produce false negatives
---
or positives. This creates uncertainty and can undermine the credibility of the
---
assessment process. Educators may struggle to discern whether the responses are
---
genuinely student-generated or if they have been provided by an AI, affecting the
---
accuracy of grading and feedback. This raises concerns about academic integrity
---
and fair assessment practices (AlAfnan et al., 2023; Kung et al., 2023).
---
•	 Ethical issues. The integration of AI chatbots in education raises several ethical
---
implications, particularly concerning data privacy, security, and responsible AI
---
use. As AI chatbots interact with students and gather data during conversations,
---
necessitating the establishment of clear guidelines and safeguards. For example,
---
medical education frequently encompasses the acquisition of knowledge pertain-
---
ing to delicate and intimate subjects, including patient confidentiality and ethical
---
considerations within the medical field and thus ethical and proper utilization of
---
chatbots holds significant importance (Masters, 2023; Miao & Ahn, 2023; Seda-
---
For these and other geopolitical reasons, ChatGPT is banned in countries with
---
strict internet censorship policies, like North Korea, Iran, Syria, Russia, and China.
---
Several nations prohibited the usage of the application due to privacy apprehen-
---
sions. Meanwhile, North Korea, China, and Russia, in particular, contended that the
---
U.S. might employ ChatGPT for disseminating misinformation. Conversely, OpenAI
---
restricts access to ChatGPT in certain countries, such as Afghanistan and Iran, cit-
---
ing geopolitical constraints, legal considerations, data protection regulations, and
---
internet accessibility as the basis for this decision. Italy became the first Western
---
country to ban ChatGPT (Browne, 2023) after the country’s data protection author-
---
ity called on OpenAI to stop processing Italian residents’ data. They claimed that
---
ChatGPT did not comply with the European General Data Protection Regulation.
---
However, after OpenAI clarified the data privacy issues with Italian data protection
---
authority, ChatGPT returned to Italy. To avoid cheating on school homework and
---
assignments, ChatGPT was also blocked in all New York school devices and net-
---
works so that students and teachers could no longer access it (Elsen-Rooney, 2023;
---
Li et al., 2023). These examples highlight the lack of readiness to embrace recently
---
developed AI tools. There are numerous concerns that must be addressed in order
---
to gain broader acceptance and understanding.
---
To summarize, incorporating AI chatbots in education brings personalized learn-
---
ing for students and time efficiency for educators. Students benefit from flexible
---
study aid and skill development. However, concerns arise regarding the accuracy of
---
information, fair assessment practices, and ethical considerations. Striking a bal-
---
ance between these advantages and concerns is crucial for responsible integration in
---
Labadze et al. Int J Educ Technol High Educ  (2023) 20:56
---
The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots in education has the potential to
---
revolutionize how students learn and interact with information. One significant advan-
---
tage of AI chatbots in education is their ability to provide personalized and engaging
---
learning experiences. By tailoring their interactions to individual students’ needs and
---
preferences, chatbots offer customized feedback and instructional support, ultimately
---
enhancing student engagement and information retention. However, there are potential
---
difficulties in fully replicating the human educator experience with chatbots. While they
---
can provide customized instruction, chatbots may not match human instructors’ emo-
---
tional support and mentorship. Understanding the importance of human engagement
---
and expertise in education is crucial. A teacher’s role encompasses more than just shar-
---
ing knowledge. They offer students guidance, motivation, and emotional support—ele-
---
ments that AI cannot completely replicate.
---
We find that AI chatbots may benefit students as well as educators in various ways,
---
however, there are significant concerns that need to be addressed in order to harness its
---
capabilities effectively. Specifically, educational institutions should implement preventa-
---
tive measures. This includes (a) creating awareness among students, focusing on top-
---
ics such as digital inequality, the reliability and accuracy of AI chatbots, and associated
---
ethical considerations; and (b) offering regular professional development training for
---
educators. This training should initially focus on enabling educators to integrate diverse
---
in-class activities and assignments into the curriculum, aimed at nurturing students’
---
critical thinking and problem-solving skills while ensuring fair performance evaluation.
---
Additionally, this training should cover educating educators about the capabilities and
---
potential educational uses of AI chatbots, along with providing them with best practices
---
for effectively integrating these tools into their teaching methods.
---
As technology continues to advance, AI-powered educational chatbots are expected
---
to become more sophisticated, providing accurate information and offering even more
---
individualized and engaging learning experiences. They are anticipated to engage with
---
humans using voice recognition, comprehend human emotions, and navigate social
---
interactions. Consequently, their potential impact on future education is substantial.
---
This includes activities such as establishing educational objectives, developing teach-
---
ing methods and curricula, and conducting assessments (Latif et al., 2023). Considering
---
Microsoft’s extensive integration efforts of ChatGPT into its products (Rudolph et al.,
---
2023; Warren, 2023), it is likely that ChatGPT will become widespread soon. Educational
---
institutions may need to rapidly adapt their policies and practices to guide and support
---
students in using educational chatbots safely and constructively manner (Baidoo-Anu &
---
Owusu Ansah, 2023). Educators and researchers must continue to explore the potential
---
benefits and limitations of this technology to fully realize its potential.
---
The widespread adoption of chatbots and their increasing accessibility has sparked con-
---
trasting reactions across different sectors, leading to considerable confusion in the field
---
of education. Among educators and learners, there is a notable trend—while learners
---
are excited about chatbot integration, educators’ perceptions are particularly critical.
